## How to Play 📜

1. The game has two players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current score.
3. If the player rolls a `1`, their current score gets lost, and it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means their current score gets added to their global score. It's then the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
